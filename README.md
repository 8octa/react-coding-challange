I orded to crate the project I have decided to use Vite.js for it's fast frontend build power.

For styling, I have opted for Tailwind CSS since it is a perfect pair with React.

My approach was to create a few simple components for reusabillity and easier workflow. The goal was to make them as dynamic as possible.

- Button
- Card
- Hero
- Menu
- Navbar

All the information was stored in info.json and icons.json files.

I have also included a light theme for the page.
